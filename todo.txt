Chicken App todo:

- Add options for multiple Observations in single session (possibly refactor Templates to Observations) then hold a list of 
  Observations on the Session object.
- Add session statistics, including:
    - Average & Range Duration (in observation)
    - Average & Range Duration (in all observations)
    - Total number of events in each observation
    - Most common followup behaviour for each behaviour (optional)

- Template manage page (including edit)
- Session history page
