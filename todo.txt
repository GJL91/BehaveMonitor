Chicken App todo:

- Validate foldername (no special characters, give warning message) *PRIORITY*
- Check just created folders are the default selected (after making a folder it picks the default folder BUG) *PRIORITY*
- Add options for multiple Observations in single session (possibly refactor Templates to Observations) then hold a list of 
  Observations on the Session object.

      - Average & Range Duration (in observation)
      - Average & Range Duration (in all observations)
      - Total number of events in each observation
      - Most common followup behaviour for each behaviour (optional)
